# We can then use this information from the nb.model to evaluate specific conditional 
# probabilities. An example would be P(AHD = YES | ChestPain = typical, Thal = Fixed)
# This is calculated by finding the conditional probabiltiy for when ChestPain is 
# typical and AHD = YES * the probability of Thal = Fixed and AHD = YES * probability
# of AHD = YES. This product will be the numerator. You would then find the product of 
# probabiltiy for when ChestPain is typical and AHD = NO * the probability of Thal = Fixed 
# and AHD = NO * probability of AHD = No. You will add the same value you obtained for the
# numerator to this product and the sum will be the denominator. 

# P(AHD = YES | ChestPain = typical, Thal = Fixed)

# P(AHD = YES | ChestPain = Typical) = 0.0306
# P(AHD = YES | Thal = Fixed) = 0.0824
# P(AHD = YES) = 0.46

# Numerator = 0.0306 * 0.0824 * 0.46 = 0.001159862

# P(AHD = NO | ChestPain = Typical) = 0.0956
# P(AHD = NO | Thal = Fixed) = 0.0263
# P(AHD = NO) = 0.54

# Denominator part A = 0.0956 * 0.0263 * 0.54 = 0.001357711
# sum the probabilities for the denominator = 0.001159862 + 0.001357711 = 0.002517573

# divide the numerator and denominator
# 0.001159862/0.002517573 =  0.4607064 or about 46%
